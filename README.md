## [Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13D_aer4FmbJjcvOlsORX2YiQnl9zOCFWXUhDRnajr-8/edit?usp=sharing)
Retina is a system for data rescue and training of machine learning algorithms. One may have hundreds of images with handwritten or typed text retained only on paper media, until the images were captured using a variety of methods with variable quality. It is a project to implement a process which can leverage help from volunteers, i.e. citizen scientists. The work performed can be viewed as variants of the same methodology: From a selected image, choose the areas with an object/thing to identify/classify, i.e. text, and show only these selected areas to a volunteer or machine learning algorithm. The data rescue function can be performed manually and completely with many features provided, such as tools for drawing, resizing, and moving shapes, i.e. rectangles. With a common interface to support one or more providers of services, it is possible to integrate functions currently out of scope for Retina, for example a Web Application which can be used by thousands of volunteers for transcription of image data. Something which Zooniverse provides for free if policies are respected. Standard Machine Learning algorithms for transcription of typed and/or handwritten text can also be applied to subset images already defined by shapes drawn on a larger image. Finally, validated transcription data along with the defined subset images can be used to create new training sets for machine learning algorithms. If a project includes especially difficult handwritten text, it may be possible to train machine learning algorithms that perform better classifications, as more images are classified by volunteers.
